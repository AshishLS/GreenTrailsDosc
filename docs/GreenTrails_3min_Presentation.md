# GreenTrails 3-Minute Presentation

**Introduction** (20 seconds):  
“Hi, my name is Ashish Shete, and I’m here with Omkaranathan Ravindran. Together, we are GreenTrails. Nordic winters are harsh, making outdoor workouts challenging. But imagine if you could wear a VR headset in your gym and be instantly surrounded by a lush, green environment. GreenTrails brings the outdoors indoors for nature-based wellness.”

**How GreenTrails Works** (45 seconds):  
“Our system combines hyper-realistic VR environments with sensors on a bike and biofeedback sensors. This setup provides an immersive experience that feels like a real ride through nature. Even a few minutes in these green settings can benefit mental and physical well-being.”

**Why Now?** (30 seconds):  
“VR isn’t new, but recent advancements have made hardware cheaper and real-time rendering faster. With increased awareness and acceptance of VR, we’ve created a product that virtually connects users with nature while they work out.”

**Market and Prototype** (45 seconds):  
“Our prototype uses off-the-shelf sensors, allowing any bike to connect to a virtual environment. The market for this in the global north is valued at 212 million dollars, targeting home users, gyms, elderly care facilities, and research institutes.”

**Closing Statement** (30 seconds):  
“Our strategy is to collaborate with gyms, health influencers, and researchers to raise awareness about our product. We’re seeking 200 thousand euros and mentorship to go from prototype to product. Let’s make a new pathway to health and well-being with GreenTrails.”
